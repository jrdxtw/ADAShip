# ADAShip 

Adaship, a take-off the classic 1v1 sea warfare game; Battleship! is a command-line game. The idea of the game is that You and an opponent each place a number of sea operated ships such as submarines, patrol boats even deadly destroyers on your own board, you must then alternate turns "firing" torpedoes and missiles at each other’s ships. The game is won when one player has destroyed or sunk all the emery player’s ships. boards will have to gather and hold data relating to placed boats, fired shots, and missed shots. The player also needs to be able to take torpedo shots and receive information on the result of the shot (hit/miss).

When all opposing warfare vehicles are destroyed then then the player wins the game. A CPU player needs to be created utilising an auto-placing feature. The boards will also need to be displayed to the user containing the placed ships and hits/misses. The game needs to prevent invalid input but also invalid auto placing & manual placements.

For this assignment the required language is C++, a low-level language from the C family. Object orientated programming (OOP) will also need to be involved throughout the program executing objects that are organized into classes, which allows individual objects to be grouped together, overall I have very little to no experience in C++ so this assignment gave me the opportunity to show what I have learnt, I have required and been given a lot of advice and help in order to for me to create an implemented solution that follows all pass requirements and implements a fully working game.
My solution includes:

Player One v AI

One player takes on the adaship battleship super computer.

Multiplayer functionality 

Two player interaction against each other, both manually entering shots.

Custom Board Dimensions

The size of the board will be loaded from a file. This means the size could be between 5x5 to 50x50, for my board size I beside to make it an optimal size for users’ depth of field and screen size fitting.
